# NJLinks

This is a simple implementation of the golinks concept in nodejs. Mostly done for personal experimentation.


## TODOs:
1. Add a better storage mechanism
2. Add control plane for add/edit/delete links
3. Frontend?

## Some notes
* This was written intentionally without frameworks (express and such). Why? I wasn't sure what are the "correct" frameworks to use. Also it's nice sometimes to work from the ground up.
* I tried to make it modular and somewhat OOP. However, I'm not sure if it's the "proper" way to do it nodejs.
* This is pure node, no Babel or other compiler/transpiler for now. Also no typescript (again, for now).
